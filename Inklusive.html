    <p>
      As part of a collaborative project, I was asked to create a logo that would represent our group and its shared mission. 
      The theme of our class centered on <strong>design history through marginalized voices</strong> cultures and creators that are often underrepresented in traditional academic narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We named our project <strong>"Inklusive"</strong>, combining the words “ink” and “inclusive” to reflect our mission: recording voices that have long been overlooked, and doing so with intention, respect, and clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our chosen tagline, <em>“Walking forward while looking back”</em>, became a guiding philosophy. It emphasizes how we can progress only by acknowledging and honoring the histories that shaped us through art, through stories, and through identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The logo design draws on the symbolism of <strong>unity and flight</strong>. Using hands of various colors, I constructed the shape of wings each hand representing a culture, a story, a legacy. Together, they create movement. Together, they rise.
