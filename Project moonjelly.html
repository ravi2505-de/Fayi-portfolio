  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <p class="moonjelly-text" data-aos="fade-down">
    For one of my final projects, we were assigned to choose a "Spirit Animal" to develop a logo and some branding around. I chose the moon jellyfish because it is one of my favorite animals, and I love aquatic themes. Moon jellies don't have the longest tendrils like other jellyfish, so in some sketches, I played around with the shape of the tentacles to make it more interesting.
    <br><br>
    Referencing actual pictures, I simplified the jellyfish and kept the iconic mark on the top of their head for recognition. It is the same reason I added the crescent moon. The brand I ended up doing was a skincare brand, because skincare products are becoming more trendy, with things like jelly face masks. I wanted the brand to be sophisticated, yet something fun you would see advertised on Soko Glam.

  <!-- Process and Ideation -->
  <p class="moonjelly-subtext" data-aos="fade-down">
    <strong>Process & Ideation:</strong> I began the design journey using traditional design thinking methodology  empathizing with the target audience (young women, 20s–30s), defining brand values (gentle, elegant, aquatic), and ideating with moodboards and pencil sketches. I iterated through rough visual concepts, refining tentacle curves, balancing organic and geometric shapes, and preserving recognition by referencing real moon jellyfish photographs.

  <!-- Logo Usage Info -->
  <p class="moonjelly-subtext" data-aos="fade-down">
    The final logo was created using Adobe Illustrator, focusing on clean bezier curves, symmetry, and legibility at small sizes. This logo was later applied across brand collateral including product packaging and mockup ads, representing the core identity of "Moonjelly Cosmetics".
